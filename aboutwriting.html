<p>
    Scholars generally agree that the earliest form of writing appeared almost 5,500 years ago in Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq). Early pictorial signs were gradually substituted by a complex system of characters representing the sounds of Sumerian (the language of Sumer in Southern Mesopotamia) and other languages.
<br>
    There are also several places such as the Indus River valley (Pakistan & Kashmir) and Rapa Nui (Easter Island) where writing may have been invented but it remains undeciphered.
<br>
    Today, I write after thousands of years of human progress and experience. I ask that as you read, you remember that it was our ancestors who brought us here and gave us life.
